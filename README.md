# Pokémon Emerald Legacy Enhanced

Pokémon Emerald Legacy Enhanced is an fork of Pokémon Emerald Legacy by [TheSmithPlays](https://www.youtube.com/@smithplayspokemon) and his incredible project team aiming to add Quality of Life improvements and updates which do not align with the Legacy project vision, but nonetheless are features which I believe enhances the game.

I have **no official affiliation** with TheSmithPlays or his incredible project team, I'm just a single developer fan who wanted to make my own flavour of Emerald Legacy with the greatest respect for the fantastic version of Emerald the team has already built. I look to regularly pull in any updates or fixes from the base Pokémon Emerald Legacy whenever the project team publishes.

Quality of Life features are included in the base patch (such as using select in the party menu to switch Pokémon positions and HMs only requiring Badge, HM in bag and a Pokémon able to learn the move (not taking up a move slot) to use them), whilst some larger deviations from the legacy vision will be separated as their own patches (such as Enhanced Starters which adds the starters for early route availability and buffs signature moves.)

**Warning for MyBoy! Android Emulator Players:**
Testers have found issues with the Stat Editor and some overworld visual glitches on MyBoy! Android Emulator. Unfortunately I have been unable to replicate or find the issue on other emulators.

My recommended emulator for Android is RetroArch with mGBA core. This is however more complex to setup and has mixed reviews for User Experience. Though I have not personally tested, PizzaBoy! for Android appears to work effectively on Android from some beta testing reports.

## Download and Play

* To download the latest patches, see [RELEASES > Latest](https://github.com/Exclsior/Pokemon_Emerald_Legacy_Enhanced/releases/latest) and download the zip file with the latest patches. Unzip the folder, then follow the instructions in the 'README.md' file.
* To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

### For the tech-savvy

The Pret Pokeemerald disassembly upon which the project is ultimately based has allowed many developers to build a myriad of amazing features, this fork primarily looks to incorporate already built and tested features. I'm happy for anybody to fork from this repository and use any feature branches, just please do credit the original feature creators as I've done below, and I'm happy to entertain pull requests if there's a feature which you've added which doesn't conflict with any other features in the game.

Without any further ado, below are the features added to Base Patch (main branch):

## Base Patch - v1.1.4:
*Branch: main*
The Base Emerald Legacy Enhanced version which primarily focuses on quality of life additions such as HM improvements, Pokémon Followers, National Dex Mode, Shiny Charms, Stat Editor for IVs and EVs, Nature Mints and an Egg Move Tutor.

This Base patch includes all updates to Pokémon Emerald Legacy source code as of 27 Feb 2025.

**Note:**: Save files from Emerald Legacy are compatibile, however it is one-way from Emerald Legacy to Enhanced and from older versions of Enhanced. Please backup original saves before moving to Enhanced.

### High Level Features:
* All Base Legacy changes as of v1.1.4.
* Pokémon followers (can be disabled).
* Unique per-Pokémon Surfing Overworld sprites instead of the "Surf blob" (can be disabled).
* Optional National Dex Mode (More information in separate National Dex section below)
* Optional in-game Shiny Charms to the player's item PC which **must** be withdrawn into the item bag to work. (More information in Shiny Charm section below)
* Removed requirement for all field moves (including HMs) to have to be learned by a Pokémon in order to be used outside of battle.
* Added gold sparkle to Feebas spots on Route 119 after recieving the Devon Scope.
* Stat Editor to edit IVs and EVs added to Party Menu after National Dex is unlocked.
* Nature Mints have been added in the game for purchase after beating Petalburg Gym.
* Ability Capsules added into the game to swap between Pokémon's abilities.
* Added Egg Move Tutor to Fallarbor Town Move Tutor's House after beating the game.
* Updated Pokédex to include evolution information.
* Added ability to fly to your Secret Base after creating one.
* Added EXP. All as reward from Mr. Stone for delivering Steven's Letter (Not Gen 6 EXP. Share, see Items section).
* Added significantly expanded Options Menu to toggle many features:
  * Further customised "L Button" shortcuts.
  * Overworld Speedup option added to speed up Player and NPC speed without speeding up Music.
  * Many more options, see Options Menu section

### National Dex Mode
National Dex Mode is an alternate play mode for new games on Emerald Legacy Enhanced allowing to select from all nine starters from the start of the game as well as having all of Base Legacy's post-game route encounters available from the start of the game (i.e Rattata as a possible rare spawn on Route 101). The game **has not** been rebalanced for National Dex Pokémon, as such I do not recommend using this game mode for your first play through of Emerald Legacy Enhanced (unless you have finished Emerald Legacy already).

**Key Notes:**
* Able to select National Dex as an option when starting a new game.
* National Dex wild encounters unlocked
  * National Dex encounters are still rarer encounters than Hoenn counterparts through the game.
* Able to choose from all 9 available Gen 1-3 starters to play
* If you select a non-Hoenn starter:
  * The rival will still have the Hoenn starter of the type super effective against yours (i.e. if you select Charmander, your rival will start with Mudkip)
  * The Hoenn starters will be available in the post-game from your rival by trading the base form of your selected starter.
  * The relevant quest or reward matching the player's starter will be shiny. (i.e. If you chose Charmander, your rival will gift you a shiny Charmander for the relevant quest.)
* No in-game trainers or battles have been updated, the game is still Hoenn leaning.
  * As a result, the game is "unbalanced" in favour of the player.
* Some post-game gift National Dex encounters remain in the post-game (such as Aerodactyl for example)
* Safari Zone is fully available to explore (meaning the Johto encounters are available in the main game)
* One Snorlax is available somewhere in the overworld before post-game. (Respawns after each E4 clear)
* Eevee is available as a gift before post-game from Lanette.
* Porygon available from Game Corner.
* First form pseudo-legendaries all available in the wild.
  * Dratini remains available in Sootopolis city with original Base Legacy post-game location.
  * As noted above, Larvitar moved to Route 111 (Desert) as 1% encounter.
    * No Larvitar encounter in Victory Road **at all**.
* All post-game legendaries from Base Legacy **remain** post-game for National Dex mode, no changes to legendary availability.
* Starter learnsets have been updated (see Pokémon Changes - Moves section)

### Shiny Charms
Completely optional to use Shiny Charms have been added to the game. These are a "secret" feature, meaning no in-game NPCs or dialogue refer to their existence.

In-game milestones for Shiny Charm acquisition (all added to Player Item PC, max 8 available per game.):
* One from start of the game
* Beating the Game (E4 and Champion)
* Getting all Contest Artworks in Lilycove Museum
* Defeating Steven in Meteor Falls
* Completing Hoenn Pokédex (And speak to Prof. Birch)
* Completing National Pokédex (And speak to game developers in Lilycove City)
* Getting all Silver Symbols in Battle Frontier
* Getting all Gold Symbols in Battle Frontier

**Key Notes:**
* Shiny Charms will be silently awarded to the player's item PC when in-game milestones have been met.
  * do not work if left or stored in the player's item PC.
* Shiny Charms only take effect if they are in the player's bag.
* Shiny Charms cannot be tossed.
* Breeding Eggs from Daycare are impacted by Shiny Charm(s) as long as they're in the bag when you collect the egg.
* Shiny Charms can be held by Pokémon and therefore traded between different Emerald Legacy Enhanced games.
  * do not change Shiny changes if held by a Pokémon
* If migrating a save and already completed a relevant milestone, the Shiny Charm will be added to your PC, except for the Pokédex Shiny Charms which require the above noted in-game tasks to be added to the PC.

**Shiny Charm Rates:**
* 0 Charms - 1/8192 (No Shiny Charms in bag) - 0.01221% - Same as original Emerald
1. 1/1024 (Available from Start of Game) - 0.09766%
2. 1/512  - 0.1953%
3. 3/1024 - 0.2930% (I suspect most people will end up here by end of their main playthrough)
4. 1/256  - 0.3906%
5. 5/1024 - 0.4883%
6. 3/512  - 0.5859%
7. 7/1024 - 0.6836%
8. 1/128  - 0.7812%

  * L = Speed: Will either step through, or toggle on/off the relevant chosen World Speed option
  * L = Fast Mode: Either toggles Auto Run, Fast Surf, World Speed and Diving speed to On or Max (as appropriate), or turns them all to Off or Minimum as appropriate.
  * L = Follower: Toggles Follower On or Off:
    * When turning off, follower will return to Pokeball immediately.
    * When toggling off, player needs to take a step for follower to spawn (if able)
  * All new above Button Modes have LR Button Mode enabled.

## Dragon Type Physical - v1.1.4:
*Branch: dragon-type-physical*

Simple swap for Dragon type to be considered Physical. This **does not** do any stat rebalancing of any Pokémon, just swaps the typing. (e.g. Salamence will benefit significantly, Latios will lose out).

### Implemented Changes:
* All changes already present in Base Patch.
* Dragon type Physical in battle.
* Updated text in Rustboro School to note change of Dragon typing to Physical.

## Dragon Grovyle and Sceptile - v1.1.4:
*Branch: sceptile-dragon*

A common request throughout the Legacy project to make the Treecko-line Dragon type.

### Implemented Changes:
* All changes already present in Base Patch.
* Grovyle and Sceptile with added Dragon type.
* Starter Level-up moves updated (changes compared to Emerald Legacy only):

    * Lvl 19: Razor Leaf
    * Lvl 34: Dragonbreath

    * Lvl 45: Dragon Claw
  * Sceptile:

    * Lvl 19: Razor Leaf
    * Lvl 34: Dragonbreath
    * Lvl 60: Outrage

## Physical Dragon Grovyle and Sceptile - v1.1.4:
*Branch: sceptile-physical-dragon*

Combination of the two above patches for physical Dragon type and to add Dragon typing to the Treecko line. Only Grovyle and Sceptile stats rebalanced, as above no other Pokémon rebalanced (e.g. Salamence will benefit significantly, Latios will lose out).

### Implemented Changes:
* All changes already present in Base Patch.
* Dragon type Physical in battle.
* Updated text in Rustboro School to note change of Dragon typing to Physical.

    * Lvl 19: Razor Leaf
    * Lvl 34: Dragonbreath
    * Lvl 60: Outrage

  * Grovyle:
    * Base Attack Increased by 5
    * Base Special Attack Decreased by 5
  * Sceptile:
    * Base Attack Increased by 10
    * Base Special Attack Decreased by 5

## Enhanced Starters - v1.1.4
*Branch: enhanced-starters*

An expansion on the Pokémon Emerald Legacy Enhanced Project which further buffs the the Starters (and my preferred way to play!). For the most balanced version, please use the base version! This version is just to feed into the childhood nostalgia feeling of having an overpowered starter throughout the game and to catch all the starters early in the game.

# Pokémon Emerald Legacy

Emerald Legacy is meant to serve as a finale to the trio of planned projects in the Legacy Trilogy led by [TheSmithPlays](https://www.youtube.com/@smithplayspokemon). It is made using the [Pokémon Emerald Disassembly](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) made by the [Pret](https://pret.github.io/) team. This game is focused on refining a game that is considered a classic by many people into a nostalgic but improved experience with 20+ years of hindsight. Emerald is a great game with a ton of flaws when you use that experience to really look at it under a lens. Terrible pokemon pool, Weird team building choices, A great story idea executed poorly, baffling rival decisions, and one of the worst E4s. This game with all of these problems manages to shrug them off with memorable dex additions, fantastic gym leader ace choices, abilities, no more stat xp, Battle frontier, original ideas to the series, and overall a solid game. The Legacy Project aims to take what is good in a game and improve it while bringing its flaws up to that same level. 

Keeping that nostalgic feeling is a key part of the project and thus requires us to temper our changes into things that improve the experience but don’t take you out of that original generation 3 mindset. Things like the Physical/Special Split, adding moves, adding new evolutions, or adding the fairy typing are not things you will find in this game. Instead look for improvements to the Rival storyline, Team Magma & Aqua storyline, Tons of pokemon balancing using the tools given to us in this generation, a robust post game, improved boss fights throughout the game, adjusted level curve, and so much more. We are not trying to create a new game, nor are we trying to create a “Kaizo” game that is insanely difficult. We wanted to create a modern but nostalgic version of Pokémon Emerald. So please enjoy Pokémon Emerald Legacy.
